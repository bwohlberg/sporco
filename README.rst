SPORCO is a Python package for solving optimisation problems with sparsity-inducing regularisation. These consist primarily of sparse coding and dictionary learning problems, including convolutional sparse coding and dictionary learning, but there is also support for other problems such as Total Variation regularisation and Robust PCA. The optimisation algorithms in the current version are based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) or on the Proximal Gradient Method (PGM).

If you use this software for published work, please `cite it <http://sporco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#citing>`__.


Documentation
-------------

`Documentation <http://sporco.rtfd.io/>`_ is available online, or can be built from the root directory of the source distribution by the command

::

   python setup.py build_sphinx

in which case the HTML documentation can be found in the ``build/sphinx/html`` directory (the top-level document is ``index.html``). Although the SPORCO package itself is compatible with Python 3.x, building the documention requires Python 3.3 or later due to the use of `Jonga <https://github.com/bwohlberg/jonga>`_ to construct call graph images for the SPORCO optimisation class hierarchies.


An overview of the package design and functionality is also available in

  Brendt Wohlberg, `SPORCO: A Python package for standard and convolutional sparse representations <http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2017/brendt_wohlberg.html>`_, in Proceedings of the 15th Python in Science Conference, (Austin, TX, USA), doi:`10.25080/shinma-7f4c6e7-001 <http://dx.doi.org/10.25080/shinma-7f4c6e7-001>`_, pp. 1--8, Jul 2017


Usage
-----

Scripts illustrating usage of the package can be found in the ``examples`` directory of the source distribution. These examples can be run from the root directory of the package by, for example

::

   python examples/scripts/sc/bpdn.py


To run these scripts prior to installing the package it will be necessary to first set the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable to include the root directory of the package. For example, in a ``bash`` shell

::

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`


from the root directory of the package.


`Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_ examples are also `available <https://github.com/bwohlberg/sporco-notebooks>`_. These examples can be viewed online via `nbviewer <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bwohlberg/sporco-notebooks/blob/master/index.ipynb>`_, or run interactively at `binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bwohlberg/sporco-notebooks/master?filepath=index.ipynb>`_.



Requirements
------------

The primary requirements are Python itself, and modules  `future <http://python-future.org>`__, `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`__, `scipy <https://www.scipy.org>`__, `imageio <https://imageio.github.io/>`__, `pyfftw <https://hgomersall.github.io/pyFFTW>`__, and `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`__. Module `numexpr <https://github.com/pydata/numexpr>`__ is not required, but some functions will be faster if it is installed. If module `mpldatacursor <https://github.com/joferkington/mpldatacursor>`__ is installed, functions ``plot.plot``, ``plot.contour``, and ``plot.imview`` will support the data cursor that it provides.

Instructions for installing these requirements are provided in the `Requirements <http://sporco.rtfd.io/en/latest/install.html#requirements>`__ section of the package documentation.


Installation
------------

To install the most recent release of SPORCO from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sporco/>`__ do

::

    pip install sporco


The `development version <https://github.com/bwohlberg/sporco>`__ on GitHub can be installed by doing

::

    pip install git+https://github.com/bwohlberg/sporco

or by doing

::

    git clone https://github.com/bwohlberg/sporco.git

followed by

::

   cd sporco
   python setup.py build
   python setup.py install

The install commands will usually have to be performed with root privileges.


SPORCO can also be installed as a `conda <https://conda.io/docs/>`__ package from the `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`__ channel

::

   conda install -c conda-forge sporco



A summary of the most significant changes between SPORCO releases can be found in the ``CHANGES.rst`` file. It is strongly recommended to consult this summary when updating from a previous version.


Extensions
