SPORCO is a Python package for solving optimisation problems with
sparsity-inducing regularisation. These consist primarily of sparse
coding and dictionary learning problems, including convolutional sparse
coding and dictionary learning, but there is also support for other
problems such as Total Variation regularisation and Robust PCA. The
optimisation algorithms in the current version are based on the
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) or on the Proximal
Gradient Method (PGM).

If you use this software for published work, please [cite
it](http://sporco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#citing).

# Documentation

[Documentation](http://sporco.rtfd.io/) is available online, or can be
built from the root directory of the source distribution by the command

	python setup.py build_sphinx

in which case the HTML documentation can be found in the
`build/sphinx/html` directory (the top-level document is `index.html`).
Although the SPORCO package itself is compatible with Python 3.x,
building the documention requires Python 3.3 or later due to the use of
[Jonga](https://github.com/bwohlberg/jonga) to construct call graph
images for the SPORCO optimisation class hierarchies.

An overview of the package design and functionality is also available in

> Brendt Wohlberg, [SPORCO: A Python package for standard and convolutional sparse
> representations](http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2017/brendt_wohlberg.html),
> in Proceedings of the 15th Python in Science Conference, (Austin, TX,
> USA), <doi:%6010.25080/shinma-7f4c6e7-001>
> \<<http://dx.doi.org/10.25080/shinma-7f4c6e7-001>\>\`\_, pp. 1\--8,
> Jul 2017

# Usage

Scripts illustrating usage of the package can be found in the `examples`
directory of the source distribution. These examples can be run from the
root directory of the package by, for example

	python examples/scripts/sc/bpdn.py

To run these scripts prior to installing the package it will be
necessary to first set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include
the root directory of the package. For example, in a `bash` shell

	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`

from the root directory of the package.

[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) examples are also
[available](https://github.com/bwohlberg/sporco-notebooks). These
examples can be viewed online via
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bwohlberg/sporco-notebooks/blob/master/index.ipynb),
or run interactively at
[binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bwohlberg/sporco-notebooks/master?filepath=index.ipynb).

# Requirements

The primary requirements are Python itself, and modules
[future](http://python-future.org), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org),
[scipy](https://www.scipy.org), [imageio](https://imageio.github.io/),
[pyfftw](https://hgomersall.github.io/pyFFTW), and
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org). Module
[numexpr](https://github.com/pydata/numexpr) is not required, but some
functions will be faster if it is installed. If module
[mpldatacursor](https://github.com/joferkington/mpldatacursor) is
installed, functions `plot.plot`, `plot.contour`, and `plot.imview` will
support the data cursor that it provides.

Instructions for installing these requirements are provided in the
[Requirements](http://sporco.rtfd.io/en/latest/install.html#requirements)
section of the package documentation.

# Installation

To install the most recent release of SPORCO from
[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sporco/) do

	pip install sporco

The [development version](https://github.com/bwohlberg/sporco) on GitHub
can be installed by doing

	pip install git+https://github.com/bwohlberg/sporco

or by doing

	git clone https://github.com/bwohlberg/sporco.git

followed by

	cd sporco
	python setup.py build
	python setup.py install

The install commands will usually have to be performed with root
privileges.

SPORCO can also be installed as a [conda](https://conda.io/docs/)
package from the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) channel

	conda install -c conda-forge sporco

A summary of the most significant changes between SPORCO releases can be
found in the `CHANGES.rst` file. It is strongly recommended to consult
this summary when updating from a previous version.
